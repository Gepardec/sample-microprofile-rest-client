= Sample application MicroProfile-Rest-Client

This repository holds the sample application for illustrating the usage of MicroProfile-Rest-Client with Thorntail, Quarkus and Wildfly, and is part of an article you find at https://www.gepardec.com/blog/
among other interesting articles.

== Description

This sample application implements a simple JEE application which uses a type safe rest client via MicroProfile-Rest-Client and runs as a microservice with Thorntail, Quarkus and as an WAR deployment in Wildfly.

== How to build

.Thorntail microservice
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Pthorntail
----

.Quarkus microservice
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Pquarkus
----

.Wildfly WAR deployment
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Pwildfly
----

== How to run

.Start Thorntail microservice
[source,bash]
----
mvn thorntail:run -Pthorntail
----

.Start Quarkus microservice
[source,bash]
----
java "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true" -jar target\microprofile-rest-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
----

TIP: Normally the maven goal ``quarkus:dev`` should start the application as well but it fails with ClassNotFoundException (org/jboss/logging/Logger). +
     I'm not familiar with Qurakus yet, so we run the jar instead.

.Start/Configure/Deploy Wildfly
[source,bash]
----
mvn wildfly:run -Pwildfly
----

== How to test

If you use Intellij then you can use the ``test.http`` file for testing the rest endpoints. +
Otherwise see the following available endpoints and use the tool of your choice.

.GET call to external resource
``GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/get``

.POST call to external resource
``POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/post``

.PATCH call to external resource
``PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8080/patch``

.DELETE call to external resource
``DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/delete``

.POST call to unknown resource on external resource
``GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/invalid``

TIP: See the logs for invoked response filter, request filter and exception mapper.
